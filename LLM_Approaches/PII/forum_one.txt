Forum One: Investigating Culture and Society
        At first glance, material and nonmaterial culture seem to be vastly distinct aspects of society. Upon examining the relationship between the two kinds of culture closer, one will find that they go hand in hand and that culturally relevant objects often represent the same key values and beliefs forming the foundation of nonmaterial culture.  This relationship can be highlighted by identifying objects that hold cultural significance and forming an understanding of why that is.
        Every day I fill up my metal water bottle from a water pitcher. I try to drink three full bottles a day to get enough water. While this seems like a monotonous task, it highlights plenty of cultural values I hold. I have a desire to be environmentally conscious, to save money, and to maintain my health.
        When I pack my bookbag in the morning, I am subconsciously confirming the value of mobility in American culture. By having all my essentials, I am free to move from place to place, whether it's heading to class, studying at D.H. Hill, or meeting up with friends. This simple act embodies a sense of independence and flexibility that is central to the college culture. It allows me to take advantage of opportunities and connect with others, making my daily routine more dynamic.
More than just a tool for playing tennis, my racket symbolizes the value placed on athleticism and fitness in America. Playing tennis fits in with the societal norms of competition and sportsmanship. If someone saw me walking with a tennis racket it would stand as a symbol for physical activity and entertainment. 
In a specific corner of my apartment lies my collection of NC State memorabilia. There are a few hats, some playing cards, and a pennant. These objects serve as symbols of my status as an NC State student and my sense of pride and belonging here. They represent the belief that college is a fundamental time in one’s life, centered on the values of education and self-growth.
Next to the assortment of NC State merchandise is a poster on the wall that has one of my favorite album covers on it, but it is more than just a poster. It stands for the art put into the album cover and the music that it represents. It stands for self-expression and creativity. Furthermore, it falls in with the social norm of decorating your room as a means of expressing individuality. The poster not only adds character to my room but connects me to the culture of personal identity.
`        When I meal prep, I use a bench scraper to pick up and move large quantities of food. Norms are common behaviors that reflect values held within a culture (Conerly 2021:74). My bench scraper upholds the norm of meal preparation that reflects the values of a college student. If you take students to be a society, then they would value affordability and time management. On a broader scale, wellness culture is increasingly popular among young people, and overall Americans value efficiency, and this object exemplifies these values well.
        The can of Red Bull sitting in my fridge furthers the representation of college student cultural norms. I will probably drink it when I have a long day of studying and assignments ahead of me, or even a long night, a common practice among stressed students. The importance of academics to us reveals why this is a cultural norm, as we place value on performing well and staying caught up. College students believe they need to overwork themselves and always be productive.
        Values in culture often represent how people should behave, but it must be recognized that values paint an ideal picture of how a society will function that is often different from reality (Conerly 2021:73). A perfect example of this phenomenon is that while Americans value cleanliness, including me, I often have dirty dishes in my sink for a day or two. This highlights an interesting duality of cultural norms; there is both a folkway of doing the dishes to maintain a clean kitchen, and a folkway of not doing the dishes out of laziness, or “having something better to do.” This juxtaposition of norms points out that what is ideal and what is real is never the same. While one action, doing the dishes, aligns more with the values of our society, leaving them in the sink does not necessarily go against the grain of our culture, as long as you get them done within a reasonable time.
        My iPhone is one of the most culturally significant objects in my possession. It represents the American norms of using the internet and communicating via calls and texts. It highlights beliefs such as the necessity of having a phone in the first place, founded in the value that information is one of the most important things in a postindustrial society. Even the everyday language that I use to communicate with my peers is entirely shaped by how I use my phone, as I get new slang and vocabulary from it.
        My desktop computer is another extremely significant object to me. I custom-built it at the beginning of 2021, with the main purpose of playing video games. While I still use it occasionally to play games, since I got to college I’ve primarily used it for school work and job searching. No two cultures share identical values, and they tend to change over time within cultures (Conerly 2021:73). As I migrated from high school to college, my values shifted, affecting how I spend my time. In high school, I viewed work as a chore, or something impeding me from spending my time how I wanted to. In college, my work has become part of building my career and carries a greater sense of responsibility. This shift reflects broader cultural values regarding education, and how different cultures carry different values. My computer’s nonmaterial relevance shifted from an outlet of entertainment to a tool to better my career and education.
        Diving into ten objects that are culturally significant to me revealed just how much material and nonmaterial culture are intertwined within society. Virtually every object has some tie to an aspect of nonmaterial culture, some more obvious than others. One of the biggest revelations of this analysis is that most objects have some kind of obvious connection to nonmaterial culture, such as my water bottle representing my wanting to avoid plastic bottles, but upon further examination, more and more cultural relations can be discovered, such as my water bottle’s connection to health and saving money. This exercise revealed to me that I experience many different cultures all at once and they all shape how I function and interact with others.
Having explored how material and nonmaterial culture are deeply connected in everyday life, it is worth considering Gerhard Lenski's classification of societies based on technological advances, which raises the question of whether technology alone is the best way to measure societal development.        
Lenski’s viewpoint of grouping societies into five categories based on their technological progress is somewhat one-dimensional. It is certainly true that a society is as advanced as its technology. Hunter-gatherer societies lacked specialization and material surplus, as they spend all their time foraging and hunting for food and they heavily rely on the environment (Conerly 2021:99). Clearly technological advances allow for us to expedite processes and become more efficient, permitting more time for sociological advancement. Yet it is important to consider other ways societies can be classified. As societies become advance, they also become more and more complex, requiring new ways to be classified. 
        The deep dive into material and nonmaterial culture alone shows how the technological advancements that Lenski uses to classify societies will lead to nonmaterial cultural changes, offering another way to classify societies: their intangible culture. This can take shape in the form of economy, politics, demographics, values, and norms. Taking these cultural aspects into consideration will lead to a more holistic understanding of modern societies.
